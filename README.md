To change the default keyboard shortcuts, click on the input field for the shortcut you want to modify and press the desired key. The input field will be automatically updated with the selected key.

## Usage of Delete Search Designs (Chrome only)

Head over to the options section of the extension > enable the delete button for search designs.
Now, whenever you are on my.clerk.io > search designs, refresh the page, and you should see a button at the bottom.
When clicking this button, it deletes all designs that match the names of the default designs.
