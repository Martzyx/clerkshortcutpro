## Usage of Delete Search Designs (Only Chrome)

Head over to the options section of the extension > enable the delete button for search designs.
Now, whenever you are on my.clerk.io > search designs, refresh the page, and you should see a button at the bottom.
When clicking this button, it deletes all designs that match the names of the default designs.
